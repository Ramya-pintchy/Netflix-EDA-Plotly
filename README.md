# Netflix-EDA-Plotly
## Introduction
This project analyzes Netflix's dataset of movies and TV Shows to explore trends, patterns,  and insights. By leveraging Python and Plotly, I created interactive visualizations to present key findings on the distribution of content, genres, ratings, release years, and more.

## Features
- [x] Comprehensive analysis of Netflix's dataset.
- [ ] Key insights on content trends, type distribution, and region-based analysis.
- [ ] Eye-Catching visualization using Mathplotlib, seaborn.

## Dataset
The dataset is sourced from Kaggle !().
It contains the following key columns:

- **Title:** Name of the movie or TV show.
- **Type:** Indicates whether the title is a Movie or a TV Show.
- **Genre:** Categories or genres of the content.
- **Release Year:** Year the content was released.
- **Country:** Country of origin.
- **Duration:** Runtime for movies and seasons for TV shows.
- **Rating:** Parental guidelines for the content.
- **Description:** Brief overview of the title.
- **Year added:** Content added on Netflix.

## Project Highlights
- **Data Cleaning:** Dealt with missing values and ensured the dataset is analysis-ready.
- **Content Type Analysis:** Explored the distribution of Movies vs TV Shows on Netflix.
- **Genre Insights:** Identified popular genres and their prevalence.
- **Release Year Trends:** Visualized the production trends over the years.
- **Country Analysis:** Mapped the geographical distribution of Netflix's content.
- **Ratings Breakdown:** Analyzed the distribution of ratings across content.
- Analyzed some key Metrics:
  1. Content Personalization
  2. Seasonality Analysis
  3. Age-appropriate Enagement
  4. Localization

## Tools and Libaries Used
- **Python**
  - Pandas: Data Manipulation and cleaning
  - Numpy: Numerical computations
  - Matplotlib: Supporting plots
- **Kaggle Notebook:** Development Enviornment
